Sketch 54 Beta launched last week and I wanted to continue with documenting new additions to the API. If you find anything that I missed, add them below in the comments. Also, if you have any questions with how things work be sure to ask!

# API Changes

### Add `colors` and `gradients` properties on Document and `globalAssets`
##### More details

- Two new asset types were added
	- `ColorAsset`
		- name, type: String (can be null)
		- color, type: String
	- `GradientAsset`
		- name, type: String (can be null)
		- gradient, type: [Gradient](https://developer.sketchapp.com/reference/api/#gradient)

##### Github PR
[https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/345](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/345)

- Pretty sure most of the work came from this PR however `sketch.getGlobalColors()` was moved to `sketch.globalAssets.colors` (not sure what commit/PR made that change)
	- I'm a little confused here bc it seems lots of the tests still use `.getGlobalColors`. Maybe move those tests over to use `sketch.globalAssets.colors`?

##### Usage 

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var colors = sketch.globalAssets.colors
// [ { type: 'ColorAsset', name: null, color: "#febe10ff", ... }]
```

Setting Global Colors (Be sure to save a copy of your global assets before playing with this!)

- Default assets can be found here (#TODO gist link)


```
var globalAssets = sketch.globalAssets
globalAssets.colors = ['#FFFFFF']

// You can set a global color with a variety of objects
// - A native MSColorAsset
// - An MSColor
// - An MSImmutableColor
// - An NSColor
// - A hex color string

// To include a name with one of the color objects use a dictionary with `color` and `name`.
globalAssets.colors = [{name: 'white', color: '#FFFFFF'}]
```

Somewhat surprisingly this doesn't work?

```
var globalColors = sketch.globalAssets.colors
globalColors = ['#FFFFFF']
```

Other useful actions

```
// Appending/Pushing a Global Color
gloablAssets.colors = []
globalAssets.colors.push('#000000')

// globalAssets.colors returns
// [ { type: 'ColorAsset', name: null, color: '#000000ff' } ]


// Removing a Color
globalAssets.colors = [{name: 'white', color: '#FFFFFF'}, '#000000']
globalAssets.colors.splice(1,1)

// globalAssets.colors returns
// [ { type: 'ColorAsset', name: 'white', color: '#ffffffff' } ]

```

Similarily for Gradients

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var globalGradients = sketch.globalAssets.gradients

// [ { type: 'GradientAsset',
//  name: null,
//  gradient: 
//   { gradientType: 'Linear',
//     from: [Object],
//     to: [Object],
//     aspectRatio: 1,
//     stops: [Array] } },
// ...
// ]
```

Setting Global Gradients

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var Style = require('sketch/dom').Style
var globalAssets = sketch.globalAssets

const myGradient = {
  gradientType: Style.GradientType.Linear,
  from: { x: 0.5, y: 0},
  to: { x: 0.5, y: 1},
  stops: [
  	{ position: 0, color: '#c0ffee'},
  	{ position: 0.5, color: '#0ff1ce'},
  	{ position: 1, color: '#bada55', },
  ]
}

globalAssets.gradients = [{
  name: 'My Gradient',
  gradient: myGradient,
}]

// You can set a global gradient with a variety of objects
// - A native MSGradientAsset
// - An MSGradient
// - An dictionary of Gradient properties.
```

Moreover, these can all be found on `Document`

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var selectedDocument = sketch.getSelectedDocument()

let documentColors = selectedDocument.colors
let documentGradients = selectedDocument.gradients
```

### API CHANGES

- The document from a library will now have a proper path (either local path or the appcast URL) ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/265))
	- Previously when you used library.getDocument() the path of the Document would be undefined. It's now set correctly.
- Add _exportFormats_ property on _Layer_ ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/280/files))
	- You can specify `size`, `suffix`, `prefix`, and `fileFomat`
	- Valid fileFormats are 
		- `jpg`
	  - `png`
	  - `tiff`
	  - `eps`
	  - `pdf`
	  - `webp`
	  - `svg`
  - Example:

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var document = sketch.getSelectedDocument()
var layer = document.selectedLayers.layers[0]

layer.exportFormats = [
    {
      size: '2x',
      suffix: '@2x',
    },
    {
      size: '1x',
      suffix: '@1x',
    }
]

// You will need to reload the inspector to see the changes appear there
document.sketchObject.inspectorController().reload()

console.log(layer)
/* Which logs:
[ { type: 'ExportFormat',
    fileFormat: 'png',
    prefix: undefined,
    suffix: '@2x',
    size: '2x' },
  { type: 'ExportFormat',
    fileFormat: 'png',
    prefix: undefined,
    suffix: '@1x',
    size: '1x' } ]
 */ 
```

- Add method to get the theme of Sketch ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/303))
	- Sketch has 2 themes: `light` and `dark`. If your plugin has some custom UI, it should support both as well.
	- Example:

```
 var theme = UI.getTheme()
  
  if (theme === 'dark') {
    // show UI in dark theme
  } else {
    // show UI in light theme
  }
```

- No need to specify the type when there is no choice (like Document.pages can only contain Pages, Layer.exportFormats can only contain ExportFormats, etc.)",
	- _I was confused by this so @mathieudutour was able to give some clarification_
	- "That's shouldn't affect anybody. Pretty much every object from the JS API is a wrapper around a native object (like _ExportFormats_ is a wrapper around _MSExportFormat_). The way the API works when creating a new wrapper is that it looks at the type field to create the underlying native object. But in some cases, there is no choices: the objects inside _exportFormats_ will always be _MSExportFormat_."
	- So instead of `layer.exportFormats = [{type: 'ExportFormat, size: '2x'}]`, you can just write `layer.exportFormats = [{size: '2x'}]`

- Add `UI.getInputFromUser` method and deprecate the other input methods ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/276/files))
	- The same UI inputs are there (`String` and `Select`) but its moved over to the method `UI.getInputFromUser`
	- Depreciated Methods
		- `UI.getStringFromUser(message, initialValue)`
		- `UI.getSelectionFromUser(message, items, selectedItemIndex)`
	- Bonus: `Slider`, `Number`, `Color`, and `Path` inputs are coming soon
	- Examples:

```
// Default type .string
UI.getInputFromUser(
	"What's your name?",
	{
      initialValue: 'Appleseed',
    },
	(err, value) => {
		if (err) {
			// most likely the user canceled the input
			return
		}
	}
)

// Type .selection  
UI.getInputFromUser(
	"What's your favorite design tool?",
	{
		type: UI.INPUT_TYPE.selection,
		possibleValues: ['Sketch']
	},
	(err, value) => {
		if (err) {
			// most likely the user canceled the input
			return
		}
	}
) 
```

- Add some `getParent*` methods on Layer ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/284))
	- You can use `getParentPage()`, `getParentArtboard()`, `getParentSymbolMaster()`, and `getParentShape()` to quickly access higher level components
	- You can also use the `parent` property on _Layer_ ~~that was added~~ to go up the layer structure. _[Edit: this was there before]_
	- Examples:

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var document = sketch.getSelectedDocument()
var layer = document.selectedLayers.layers[0]

layer.getParentPage() // gets the page
layer.getParentArtboard() // gets the containing artboard
layer.getParentSymbolMaster() // you get the idea now...

layer.parent // goes up one level
layer.parent.parent // you can continue to chain all the way up
document.parent // will be undefined

```

- Add support for text styles ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/283))
	- LOTS of added functionality here
	- Depreciated Methods
		- `Text.systemFontSize`
		- `Text.alignment` (its moved to `Text.style.alignment`)
	- Added properties to `Text.style`
		- `alignment`
			- `left`, `center`, `right`, `justified`
		- `verticalAlignment`
			- `top`, `center`, `bottom`
		- `kerning`
			- default to `null` if there is none set
			- _(there was an a floating point issue with the returned values but its been fixed here_ [Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/322)_)_
		- `lineHeight`
			- defaults to `null` if nothing is set
			- You can get the default line height from the method `getDefaultLineHeight()` ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/318))
		- `textColor`
			- note that it can set in various formats `#000`, `#000000`, and the opacity variant `#000000FF`
		- `fontSize`
		- `textTransform`
			- `uppercase`, `lowercase`, and `none`
		- `fontFamily`
		- `fontWeight`
			- Default is 5
			- If you attempt to set the weight to something that the font doesn't support Sketch will attempt to pick the closest one.
		- `fontStyle`
			- `italic` , `normal`
			- default to `undefined`
			- setting this property to `normal` will return `undefined` if you later read it
		- `fontStretch`
			- `condensed`, `normal`
			- default to `undefined	`
			- setting this property to `normal` will return `undefined` if you later read it
		- `textUnderline`
			- `single`, `none`, `double dot`, `dot double`, `thick dash-dot`
			- default to `undefined`
			- setting this property to `double dot` or `dot double` will both return `double dot` if you later read it
			- setting this property to `none` will return `undefined` if you later read it
		- `textStrikethrough`
			- `single`, `none`, `double dot`, `dot double`, `thick dash-dot`
			- default to `undefined`
			- setting this property to `double dot` or `dot double` will both return `double dot` if you later read it
			- setting this property to `none` will return `undefined` if you later read it
	- Examples

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var document = sketch.getSelectedDocument()
var Text = require('sketch/dom').Text
var Rectangle = require('sketch/dom').Rectangle

const text = new Text({
  text: 'blah',
  frame: new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100),
  parent: document.pages[0].layers[0] //If you want to bind it to an artboard
})

// Below are the default props with on the new Text object

text.style
// { type: 'Style',
// ...
// alignment: 'left'
// verticalAlignment: 'top'
// kerning: null
// lineHeight: null
// textColor: '#000000ff'
// fontSize: 12
// textTransform: 'none'
// fontFamily: 'Helvetica'
// fontWeight: 5
// fontStyle: undefined
// fontStretch: undefined
// textUnderline: undefined
// textStrikethrough: undefined
// }

```

- Add some methods to store a session variable ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/302))
	- Session variables let you store a value which is persisted when the plugin finishes to run but is _not_ persisted when Sketch closes. It is useful when you want to keep a value between plugin's runs.
	- Note that you still have `setSettingForKey` which will let you store things after closing Sketch.
	- Examples:

```
var Settings = require('sketch/settings')

Settings.sessionVariable('myVar')
// undefined

Settings.setSessionVariable('myVar', 0.1)
Settings.sessionVariable('myVar')
// 0.1

```

- Allow using setting methods even from the Run Script panel ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/302))
	- Previously you couldn't test anything from `'sketch/settings'` in the script panel and now you can!

- Ability to make Slices ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/280/files))
	- _I previously couldn't get this to work but now I can :D_
	- You can make one by `const slice = new Slice({ name: 'Test' })`
	- You can also pass in _exportFormats_ and a parent to tie it to a layer or object

```
const artboard = new Slice({
		parent: sketch.getSelectedDocument().selectedPage,
		exportFormats: [
		{
          size: '2x',
          suffix: '@2x',
		},
	],
})    
```

- setTimeout and all the other timeout, interval, immediate methods are now available directly, no need to polyfill them. 
	- _(I think this is the [Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/279/files) however the diff seems to be about fixing an issue with fragments_ 🤔_)_

- A useful new method on the _path module_ to get resources in the plugin bundle ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/295))
	-  `require('path').resourcePath(string)`  returns the path to a resource in the plugin bundle or `undefined` if it doesn't exist.

- A new action was added called LayersResized. ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/323))
	- The action context for this action contains two keys:
		-  `document`: The document where the action was triggered
		-  `layers`: An array of the layers being resized
	-  Example:

```
// In your manifest.json you will need to add / modify the commands object
  "commands": [
	...
    {
      "name": "layerResized",
      "identifier": "myLayerResized",
      "script": "./my-command.js",
      "handlers": {
        "actions": {
          "LayerResized.begin" : "layerResizedMethod"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  ...
  
 // And then in your my-command.js you can add this function
  export function layerResizedMethod(context) {
  	// Do some fancy stuff here with context.document or context.layers
  }
  
  // Remember, some actions have a begin and finish phase so if you
  // want the action to trigger once, you should modify the handler
  // to be YourAction.begin or YourAction.finish. If you don't add
  // anything, the action will be triggered twice.
  // See https://developer.sketchapp.com/guides/action-api/ for more info

```
- You can now control whether or not a property is 'editable' for a Symbol Master override. Symbol instance overrides also have a property called 'editabled' ([Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/323))
	- Example:

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var document = sketch.getSelectedDocument()
var Artboard = require('sketch/dom').Artboard
var Text = require('sketch/dom').Text
var SymbolMaster = require('sketch/dom').SymbolMaster

const artboard = new Artboard({
  name: "test",
  parent: document.selectedPage
})

const text = new Text({
  text: 'test text value',
  parent: artboard
})

const master = SymbolMaster.fromArtboard(artboard)
master.overrides[0].editable = false
const instance = master.createNewInstance()
instance.parent = document.selectedPage
instance.overrides[0].editable
// false
```

- Obj-C exceptions will be thrown as JS Errors which will reference the exception in their `nativeException` property 
	- _I believe its this_ [Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/324)
	- _I don't know how to trigger an objective-c execption but will document one here if someone comments with an example or if I stumble upon one in the near future_

- You can now detach symbol instances recursively so that nested symbols also detach. [Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/321)
	- `instance.detach()` will just detach the outer symbol
	- `instance.detach({recursively:true})` will detach nested symbols as well

- You can now rotate layers. In addition, you can flip them vertically or horizontally. [Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/309)
	- These can be found under the `transform` property
	- You can set and get them as you would expect:

```
var layer = document.selectedLayers.layers[0]
layer
// { type: 'Text',
// ...
// transform:
//    { rotation: 0,
//      flippedHorizontally: false,
//      flippedVertically: false },
// ...

layer.transform.rotation = 10
document.sketchObject.inspectorController().reload()
// be sure to reload the inspector to see your changes

layer.transform.rotation
// 10
```
- You can now get access to an Artboard's background properties [Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/311)
	- `background.enabled`
		- boolean, if the background is shown or not
	- `background.includedInExport`
		- boolean, if the background should be exported or if it should be transparent during the export
	- `background.color`
		- string, the rgba representation of the background color
	- Example

```
var Artboard = require('sketch/dom').Artboard
const artboard = new Artboard({name: 'Test'})

artboard
// { type: 'Artboard',
// ...
// background: { enabled: false, includedInExport: true, color: '#ffffffff' } }
```
- `export` can now export to JSON [Github PR](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/SketchAPI/pull/306)
	- Example:

```
var sketch = require('sketch')
var Shape = require('sketch/dom').Shape
const object = new Shape()
const options = { formats: 'json', output: false }
const sketchJSON = sketch.export(object, options)
console.log(sketchJSON)
// big JSON file

```
